This project is an interactive web application that allows users (mainly Burundians for now. I will need to incorporate a translation tool or translate some of the riddles into English or French myself) to play with Burundian riddles (Ibisokozo). Inspired by traditional Burundian culture, the app presents riddles, multiple-choice answers, and explanations of their meanings, helping users learn about Burundi’s culture in a fun and engaging way.
