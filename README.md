This project is an interactive web application designed primarily for Burundians, though it can be adapted for English- and French-speaking users by incorporating a translation tool or manually translating selected riddles. The app allows users to explore and play with Burundian riddles (Ibisokozo), presenting them with riddles, multiple-choice answers, and explanations of their meanings. Inspired by traditional Burundian culture, it provides a fun and engaging way to learn about Burundi’s heritage. Additionally, the application tracks users’ progress, allowing them to monitor their evolution over time, and includes the ability to keep track of scores, enhancing the interactive and educational experience.
